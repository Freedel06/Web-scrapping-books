# Web-scrapping-books
In general, the goal of this project is to develop our skills in data collection using the "websrapping" method on the python software and create a database. More precisely, this one consists in collecting the different information concerning different categories of books.
The site on which the information to be recovered can be found is: http://books.toscrape.com
